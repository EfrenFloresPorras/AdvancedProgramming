Building a file encryption/decryption program using AES can be a challenging and rewarding project. Here's a step-by-step outline to help you get started:

Choose a C++ library: Select a C++ library that provides AES encryption functionality. Popular choices include Crypto++ and OpenSSL. You'll need to install and set up the library according to its documentation.

Input handling: Design a user interface that allows users to specify the file they want to encrypt or decrypt, as well as the encryption key. You can use command-line arguments or a graphical interface depending on your preference.

Key generation: Implement a key generation mechanism. You can either allow users to input a key or generate a random key using a secure pseudo-random number generator.

File encryption: Read the contents of the input file and encrypt the data using the AES encryption algorithm. You'll need to break the input file into blocks and apply the AES encryption algorithm to each block. Be sure to handle any padding requirements and select an appropriate encryption mode (e.g., CBC, ECB).

File decryption: Implement the reverse process of file encryption. Read the encrypted file, apply the AES decryption algorithm to each block, and reconstruct the original file.

Key management: Explore different key management techniques to enhance security. You can consider options like key derivation functions (KDFs) to derive a key from a user-provided password or storing the key in a separate file protected by a passphrase.

Error handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios, such as file not found, incorrect passwords, or decryption failures.

Testing: Test your program thoroughly with different file types, sizes, and encryption configurations. Verify that encrypted files can be correctly decrypted and that decrypted files match the original ones.

Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation that explains how to use your program, including any dependencies and encryption modes supported.

Remember to adhere to best practices for secure programming and encryption. Ensure that your program handles sensitive information, such as encryption keys, securely. Additionally, consider seeking advice from security experts or consulting cryptographic guidelines to ensure the security of your implementation.
